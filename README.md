# Welcome to Lambda School Machine Learning

1. What is Lambda School
  * Intensive training
  * 45 * 26 hours
  * 15 * 52 hours
  * Application over Theory
  * Educational models
2. Who am I
2. What is the Machine Learning Course
  * A wide spectrum of topics in ML, AI, and data science
  * A focus on personal presentation and knowledge
  * A ML framework for producing results for businesses
  * A set of skills to compete in the ML world
  * A set of demos to showcase those skills
3. What is Machine Learning (ML)
  * ML is applied mathematics
  * ML is using numerical techniques to produce hidden information
  * ML is making predictions on data too vast for a human to analyzE
  * ML is data intuition, preparation, and sharing
4. What will I be teaching during the ML course
  * High level ML syllabus discussion
  * Computer science
  * Personal presentations
  * Advanced computer operation in support of ML
5. What's the point of learning ML
  * In demand
  * Producing more results than before
  * Many big names say it is only going to get more important
6. How do we get started?

`Why.md`

You must answer the following question:
Why do you want to learn Machine Learning?

The following questions are to help you plan your response, but specifically
addressing each question is not required.
What is exciting about ML?  What do you think the best job opportunities are in ML? What do you think you need to do to make yourself employable in ML? What dangers are there in studying ML? Are the moral or ethical considerations that you will be responsible for?

Being from a philosophy background,  I like to look at the world, decisions, forces, etc as probabilities.  This doesn't usually make sense to people, but basically I believe that everything has the potentiality of being something else, like people in the next state over have the potential of existing because we can't be 100% certain of anything.  Since I'm accepting and understanding of these probabilities and weights, it makes it a lot easier to understand some of the concepts already covered in ML, but I don't have the classical training to turn it into a program or algorithm.  As far as immediate interests I think turning these probabilities and creating learning algorithms would be amazing for AI in video games, teaching a computer to weigh probabilities based on human input, sound, eye tracking movements, etc would be a 'simple' application that's pretty immediately testable and gratifying.  Of course using an algorithm like this just for video games seems like a waste of the talent going into it, and I think that if tweaked the right way could be used scientifically for new theories or as a way to anticipate human nature.  Morally I think that anything that has to do with anticipating human nature will be attempted to be weaponized or to create something like the "Minority Report", but having impartial human supervisors could help assist in making informed decisions.
